## Introduction

NOTE: This is an Objective-C port of [MapKitGoogleStyler](https://github.com/fmo91/MapKitGoogleStyler) by fmo91.  Use it if you are unable (or unwilling) to use Swift in your project, otherwise you can use [the original](https://github.com/fmo91/MapKitGoogleStyler).

MBMapKitGoogleStyler allows you to include Google Maps JSON styles, that you can create [here](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/), and customize your MKMapView to look just like you want (or your client). Including this library is very very easy.
